GitHub & Git are most commonly used source control systems, both in academia and in the industry. They allow you to safe-keep your source code in the cloud in repositories and synchronize the repositories on computers for incremental code development.
Steps to install them:

----
**GitHub**
- [ ] If you do not have already a [GitHub](https://github.com/)  account, create one following these steps:
	- [ ] Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and click "*Sign up*". 
	- [ ] Make sure you are providing your school email, and you have access to that email inbox: you'll have to confirm a code sent to that address.
- [ ] Login in your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- [ ] If you account has not joined [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education), follow the following steps:
	- [ ] Got to [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education) and click "*Join GitHub Education*" then "*Start an application*"
	- [ ] Select "*Student*" role, search and locate your school then click "*Share Location*", then "*Continue*".
	- [ ] You'll need to take a photo of your student ID and upload it to the site.
	- [ ] Submit the application - it might take a couple of days for it to be approved and to unlock the premium AI features in your account.
	This step gives you access to GitHub copilot such that you can use the premium features of the AI.
- [ ] Open a new tab in the same browser, go to [_CodeSinaia-2025_](https://github.com/inproted/CodeSinaia-2025) and click _Fork_.
- [ ] Go with all default settings then click "*Create fork*".

----
**Git**
- [ ] [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it on your computer.
	- [ ] For Windows systems, start the installation from the first link on the page: "_Click here to download_".
	- [ ] In the setup wizard go with the <u>default settings for most pages with the <b>exception of the following</b></u>:
	- [ ] Page  "**Choosing the default editor used by Git**" >  select "**Use Notepad++ as Git's default editor**".
	- [ ] Page "**Configuring the line ending conversations**" > select "**Checkout as-is, commit as-is**".
	- [ ] Page "**Configuring the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash**" > select "**Use Windows' default console window**".
- [ ] Verify installation:
	- [ ] Launch a command window (Start menu > type "**cmd**")
	- [ ] In the command window type "git --version". You should see an output like below:

```
    C:\Users\Florin>git --version
    git version 2.50.1.windows.1

    C:\Users\Florin>
```

----
**CodeSinaia-2025**
- [ ] Open a command window. (On Windows click "Start" button then type in "cmd")
- [ ] In the command window create a folder where you intend to store your code and clone the [_CodeSinaia-2025_](https://github.com/inproted/CodeSinaia-2025) repository via these steps:
```
    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.26100.4349]
    (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
    
    C:\Users\Florin>mkdir git
    
    C:\Users\Florin>cd git
    
    C:\Users\Florin\git>git clone https://github.com/C-FlorinTeo/CodeSinaia-2025.git
    Cloning into 'CodeSinaia-2025'...

```
<u>Note</u>: You'll have your own user name instead of Florin and your own GitHub handle instead of C-FlorinTeo.

----
**Verification**: If all went well you should be able to test that git has your local repository synced up with your GitHub (remote) repository:
```
    C:\Users\Florin\git>cd CodeSinaia-2025

    C:\Users\Florin\git\CodeSinaia-2025>git pull
    Already up to date.

    C:\Users\Florin\git\CodeSinaia-2025>
```
