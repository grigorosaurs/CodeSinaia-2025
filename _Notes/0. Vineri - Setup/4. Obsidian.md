**Obsidian** is a powerful, note-taking and knowledge management app designed as a collection of interconnected notes â€” kind of like your own private Wikipedia.
Steps to install Obsidian and related extensions:

- [ ] Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) and launch it, going with all default options.
- [ ] Once opened, select "*Open folder as vault*" and in the file dialog that opens find the folder where you cloned your **CodeSinaia-2025** repository.
	Select the _\_Notes_ subfolder from that location (i.e. `"C:\Users\Florin\git\CodeSinaia-2025\_Notes"`- with your user name instead of Florin)
	If all went well, you should see the app listing all the setup steps we are currently following through, like this:

- [ ] In the lower left part of the window locate the settings icon and click on it.
- [ ] Navigate to *Settings* >  *Community Plugins* and click on "*Turn on community plugins*", then click on "*Browse*".
- [ ] Search and install the following plugins:
	- [ ] *Control Characters*: Install & enable: Settings > Control Characters > check all
	- [ ] *Editor Width Slider*: Install & enable: Increase page width from status bar slider.
- [ ] Back in the *Settings* page, towards the lower left side you'll see the two plugins that we just installed
	- [ ] Click on "*Control Characters*" and enable "*Only show control characters in selection*"

Obsidian is installed: you can now inspect the _\_Readme_ file for the remaining setup steps.
