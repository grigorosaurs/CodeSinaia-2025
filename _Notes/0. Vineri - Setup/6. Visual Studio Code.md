Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a powerful free Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used in academia and in industry. It is lightweight and extensible, allowing coding in a large set of programming languages (Python, C, C++, Java, C#, ...) by means of specific extension modules.
Steps to install VSCode:

- [ ] Click on *Start* button and type "*Store*". Click on the *Microsoft Store* app that shows up.
- [ ] In *Microsoft Store* search for "*visual studio code*" and select the "Visual Studio Code" app that shows up to the top and click "*Install*".
  <u>Note</u>: Do **not** install "Visual Studio Code - Insiders", which is a pre-release version: more features but less stable.

----
**VSCode Extensions**:
- [ ] Once installed, open VSCode. On the left side of the window, the 5th Icon from the top is the "*Extensions*" pane. Click on it and search for "*CodeSinaia 2025*" There should be one extension only showing up:

- [ ] Alternatively, the following extensions can be installed manually, one by one:
	- [ ] *Python* - which installs *Python Debugger* and *Pylance* at the same time.
	- [ ] *Jupyter* - which installs *Jupyter Cell Tags*, *Jupyter Keymap*, *Jupyter Notebook Renderers* and *Jupyter Slide Show* at the same time.
	- [ ] *GitHub Copilot* - which installs *GitHub Copilot Chat* at the same time.
	- [ ] *indent-rainbow* - useful to highlight the code indentation, which is a core necessity in python.

----
**CodeSinaia-2025** repo setup:
- [ ] In VSCode click on "*File*" menu, then on "*Open Folder*".
- [ ] In the Open Folder window, navigate to the location of your local repo (i.e. `C:\Users\Florin\git\CodeSinaia-2025`), then click "*Select Folder"*.
- [ ] A dialog may pop up asking you to Acknowledge the folder is trusted. Please do so.

If all went well, you'll notice in the *Explorer* pane (first button from the left bar) the content of your local **CodeSinaia_2025** repository.
- [ ] From the *Explorer* pane, click & open the "*HelloPython.py*". Run it by clicking the *Run* button on the top-right side of the edit window.
   You should see a terminal window with an output like the following:
```
 PS C:\Users\Florin\git\CodeSinaia-2025.src> & C:/Users/Florin/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps/python3.13.exe c:/Users/Florin/git/CodeSinaia-2025.src/HelloPython.py
Hello Python World!
PS C:\Users\Florin\git\CodeSinaia-2025.src> 
```
- [ ] Open next the "*HelloJupyter.ipynb*" file. Run it by clicking on the "Run All" button on top of the edit window.
   You should see a popup asking for the Jupyter kernel to be installed. Please acknowledge and let the installation process to complete (less than a minute). When installation completes, you should see the output of the code block generated right underneath it:

**Copilot:**
- [ ] In VSCode, click on the account icon (lower on the left bar, above the settings button) and Login with your GitHub account.
- [ ] On the top bar, next to the search bar, click on the *Copilot* icon and follow the instructions to enable Copilot on your GitHub account.
- [ ] Open the Copilot chat window and type a "Hello there ..." prompt to verify it is setup correctly
